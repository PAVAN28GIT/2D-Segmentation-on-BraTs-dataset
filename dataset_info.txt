The BraTS dataset consists of 3D MRI scans (volumes) and corresponding segmentation masks

It includes MRI scans from patients, providing four different MRI modalities (means 4 channels of information - 4 different volumes of the same region) per patient:

Native (T1)
Post-contrast T1-weighted (T1ce - contrast enhanced)
T2-weighted (T2)
T2-FLAIR (T2 - Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery)

Each patient has 4 MRI modalities (t1, t1ce, t2, flair) and a segmentation mask.


Annotations (labels):

Label 0: Not Tumor (NT) volume
Label 1: Necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET)
Label 2: edema (ED)
Label 3: Missing (No pixels in all the volumes contain label 3)
Label 4: GD-enhancing tumor (ET)

As there are no pixels with the label 3, we will be replacing label 3 with label 4 so that there is continuity between the labels.


Training set: 369 patients
Validation set: 125 patients
Test set: 254 patients


240 x 240 pixels in the xy-plane (2D slice of the MRI).
155 slices in the z-axis (the 3D volume along the brain's depth).

Converting to 2D:
Each slice along the axial plane of the 3D image is extracted and saved as a separate 2D image.
In your code, this is done inside the loop for slice_idx in range(multi_channel_data.shape[2]), where you're iterating through the depth (i.e., the number of slices) of the 3D image.
Each slice_idx corresponds to a 2D slice from the 3D volume.
For example:

If your 3D image has a shape of (240, 240, 155), you extract the 155 slices and treat them as 2D images.
These 2D slices will have the shape (240, 240, 4) (where 4 corresponds to the 4 modalities stacked as channels).


What is stored in BraTS20_Training_002_images.npy?
BraTS20_Training_002_images.npy will store all the 2D slices for the patient BraTS20_Training_002, each slice having 4 channels (corresponding to the 4 modalities: FLAIR, T1, T1c, T2).
The shape of BraTS20_Training_002_images.npy will be (num_slices, Height, Width, 4).
num_slices corresponds to the number of slices (e.g., 155 slices).
Height and Width are 240 each.
4 corresponds to the 4 modalities stacked together.
So, the data in BraTS20_Training_002_images.npy will look like this:

A list of num_slices 3D images of shape (240, 240, 4).
In other words, each slice is a 2D image where the channels correspond to the 4 different modalities.
